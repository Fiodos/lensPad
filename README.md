## LensPad

LensPad was the application I build during the Polygon BUIDL 2022 Hackathon. It is an application which is build on top of the Lens Protocol on the Polygon Testnet (Mumbai). It allows anyone with a web3 wallet + Lens Protocol Profile to publish && sell their work (Novels, Book, other kinds of long format publications) in a permissionless way. Publications can also be reviewed by people who collected (bought) the publication.
